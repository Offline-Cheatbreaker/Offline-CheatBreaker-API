The Offline CheatBreaker API will allow you to detect when a player is running CheatBreaker, enable and disable HUD modules, allow x-ray for your staff, and much more.

## Compatibility

This API has been tested with Spigot 1.7.10, PaperSpigot 1.7.10 and mSpigot 1.7.10 (MineHQ Spigot). However, it can work on other/newer versions as well.

This API can detect people on Offline CheatBreaker 1.7.10 and 1.8.9.

**Please note** that you must add ProtocolLib to your server for the API to work! (You can get the latest one for 1.7.10 [here](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/releases/tag/3.7.0)).
